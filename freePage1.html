        <h1>5 cosas para hacer en Bariloche</h1>
        <p>
          At the heart of Argentina’s Lake District is the alpine-style town of
          Bariloche. Its culture is Patagonia-meets-Switzerland – with lakeside
          log chalets a stone’s throw away from Nahuel Huapi National Park –
          where adventures in the Andes mountains await.

              attractions in just one day. Drive along the banks of Nahuel Huapi
              Lake, visit the traditional farms in Colonia Suiza, sail to the
              Quetrihue Peninsula, and more, stopping at numerous vista points
              along the way. This full-day tour includes all of the
              transportation and information you need for an insightful,
              hassle-free trip.

              If the timing of your trip is right – June to October is ski
              season – hit the slopes on the mountains just next to Bariloche.
              Cerro Catedral is the most popular ski resort in the area and it’s
              just a quick bus ride from the city center. There’s an
              Alpine-inspired village at the bottom with bars, restaurants,
              hotels, and hostels, so you can even choose to stay here if you
              fancy having ski-in/ski-out accommodation. They’ve got 53 trails
              and slopes for all skill levels, including wide open snow fields,
              backcountry bowls, and off-piste areas. You’ll be skiing against
              some dramatic backdrops with constant views of the surrounding
              national park and mountains at what’s been widely acclaimed as the
              most complete and modern ski resort in South America.

            <h4><b>Parque Nacional Nahuel Huapi</b></h4>
            <p>
              Bariloche sits right on the edge of Nahuel Huapi, so you’ve got no
              excuse if you don’t walk, drive, camp, or boat through this
              beautiful national park with its many lakes, waterfalls,
              mountains, and forests. If you hike the Circuito Chico (the short
              loop) around Lago Nahuel Huapi – from Bariloche to Llao Llao –
              you’ll see rocky peaks, racing rivers, exquisite glaciers, and
              wildlife. If you’d prefer to hop on a boat, you can depart from
              Puerto Pañuelo and visit Puerto Blest, where you can disembark,
              hike through the forests, and visit Laguna and Cascada Los
              Cántaros. You can even go kayaking on the lake, which is actually
              the remnant of a glacier, or take a boat trip out to Victoria
              Island, a natural reserve right in the middle.

            <h4><b>Cerro Tronador and the Black Glacier</b></h4>
            <p>
              Named for the thunderous avalanches that pound down the
              mountainside, Mount Tronador is the highest peak within Nahuel
              Huapi National Park. It actually has three peaks – one Argentine,
              one Chilean, and one that’s in international territory, with
              multiple glaciers which people attempt to trek with ice axes and
              crampons. Tours of the mountain, along with hikes, start with a
              winding drive along paved and gravel roads, and usually include
              stops at waterfalls, lunch at a refugio (a restaurant that offers
              shelter to hikers at night), and visits to the Ventisquero Negro
              (Black Glacier) at the base of Mount Tronador. If you do it
              yourself, spend the day at Pampa Linda admiring the views from the
              valley, or hike up to one of the refugios or huts for a little
              adventure.
